            We are using water as the source for the liter and gram. Why not use
            it for our tempature scale. When it comes to water we are often
            concerned with two tempatures, the freezing and boiling point.
            <br />
            <br />
            What if we set 0 as the freezing point of water. Then set 100 as the
            boiling point of water? Then we have 100 units or degrees(°) to work
            with. This is keeping with our theme of being practical. After
            testing this scale in different tempatures in between freezing and
            boiling a nice pattern emerges.
            <br />
            starting at 0 and moving to 10 is cold and coat weather.
            <br />
            Moving towards 20 is cooler and needs jacket. <br />
            Nearing 30 is hot and time for shorts. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            We could work this into a little poem to make it easy to remember:
          </p>

          <MediaBox>
            <p>
              30 is hot.
              <br />
              20 is pleasing.
              <br />
              10 is cold
              <br />
              0 is freezing
              <br />
            </p>
          </MediaBox>

            Ok I understand that some of this is preference and one might wear a
            jacket while another just chooses long sleeves, but this can be a
            good rule of thumb. As we live with the system we will get an
            understanding of our personal preferences and adjust accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some other temps we might want to remember. <br />
            Room tempature is around 20° to 22°.
            <br />
            Our body tempature is about 37°.
          </p>
          <p>
            We metioned in the section defining the{" "}
            <Link href="/ametrica/gram">
              <a>Gram</a>
            </Link>
            that water&apos;s weight changes in different tempatures. We can
            find which tempature water is at its most dense and use that for our
            gram. Turns out it is <i>4°</i>. Now we can build scales!
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, for the name of this system. Here is where we will take a
            detour from our method of naming and name it after a person Anders
            Celsius. By going with Celsius and not a more general Greek term for
            tempature, we can avoid confusion with another tempature system we
            might need for something else; like measuring absolute zero.
          </p>

            This has been great fun. We create a system that is extremely
            practical. I would say we can continue to create things, but there
            is no need. The system I speak of already exist and ready to be
            used. It already has the measures we worked through and more.
            <br />
            <br />
            Sadly, the US has lagged behind our peers in fully embracing the
            system. Would you like to know more about our transition?
